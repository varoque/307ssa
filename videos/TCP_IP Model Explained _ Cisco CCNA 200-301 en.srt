00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey whats up guys? Welcome to CertBros

2
00:00:02,434 --> 00:00:06,306
In this video, we're going to be talking about the TCP/IP model

3
00:00:17,478 --> 00:00:21,518
Quick warning, we're going to be referencing the OSI model a lot here

4
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:25,968
so if you haven't already watched that video check that out first then come back

5
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:31,009
ok so what is the TCP/IP model? It's a model to

6
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:36,948
standardize computer networking. Sound
familiar? It should because it's the same

7
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:41,371
description as the OSI model.
Now the OSI model while widely

8
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:47,770
referenced isn't used in the real world
the TCP/IP model, however, is the real deal

9
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:53,608
Thankfully is not that different
here is the TCP/IP model.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,262
Four simple layers, application, transport, internet and link

11
00:00:59,886 --> 00:01:07,614
And just like the OSI model, it's numbered from the bottom up, but the direction depends on if you're sending or receiving traffic

12
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:12,270
So this is the original model but it has been updated

13
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,549
Here is the brand new freshly designed model

14
00:01:16,526 --> 00:01:20,744
One extra layer and one renamed layer

15
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:21,536
that's it

16
00:01:21,943 --> 00:01:25,779
the link layer has been
split into datalink and physical

17
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:29,595
and the internet layer has
been renamed the network layer

18
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:30,884
simple right?

19
00:01:31,237 --> 00:01:36,413
It gets even better when we compare the TCP/IP model to the OSI model

20
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:41,686
Now if you remember the OSI model
has seven layers compared to our five here

21
00:01:42,404 --> 00:01:46,357
but when you look at it you'll
notice the application presentation and

22
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:51,797
the session layers are just shown as
application layer in the tcp/ip model

23
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:56,855
all the other layers line up nicely
which is great because we should already

24
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:57,877
know the concept of how this works

25
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:00,782
So let's remind ourselves about the

26
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:06,002
protocols and devices at each layer. At
the application layer we have

27
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:12,218
application protocols such as HTTP FTP
and SMTP.

28
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:21,316
The two most common transport protocols are TCP and UDP. Port numbers
are also added here. At the network layer

29
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:26,881
we have the Internet Protocol or IP.
Routers also operate at this layer.

30
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:29,172
The data link layer contains ethernet

31
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:35,171
Switches typically at this layer, although you can get layer
3 switches that have some routing capabilities

32
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,895
Finally, we have the physical layer. Think of everything we

33
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:44,098
can touch and feel here. Things like
cables and network interface cards

34
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:52,245
Ok, so as we send data each layer will add
its own bit of information. This process

35
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:58,243
is called encapsulation. When we hit the
physical layer the data is transmitted

36
00:02:58,243 --> 00:03:02,297
over to the receiving device. The
receiving device then starts to

37
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:07,053
decapsulate the data. We saw this in the
OSI model but in this video we're going

38
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:13,000
to take a closer look. We start with our
application data at layer 5 this is then

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,945
passed down to the next layer where the
transport information is added. Let's say

40
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:23,193
is a TCP header. Each time a header is
added this will contain specific

41
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:28,287
information. For example a TCP header
will contain things like the source and

42
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:33,000
destination port number, sequence numbers and a few more bits of information.

43
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:36,190
We'll go over this in more detail in a
separate video. We then move to the

44
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:42,520
network layer where we add the IP header.
This will contain the source and

45
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:48,430
destination IP address as well as some
other bits of information. Lastly we have

46
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:54,433
the data link layer. Here we add not only
a header but a trailer as well. The

47
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,180
header contains main lead the
destination and source MAC address and

48
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,078
the trailer contains some error checking
information that the receiving side can

49
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:06,261
check and make sure the data has been
received correctly. Once the data hits

50
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:09,564
the physical layer it is physically
transmitted

51
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:14,747
so we've gone through the encapsulation
process. It's important to note that at

52
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:22,036
each stage the data has a specific name. At layer five the data is called, well

53
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:26,415
it's just called data at this stage. Once
the transport information has been added

54
00:04:26,415 --> 00:04:31,455
it's now called a segment. Adding the
network layer information makes our

55
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:38,114
segment a packet and finally once we add
our data link information the packet

56
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:44,633
becomes a frame. Now once data has been transmitted the receiving computer decapsulates

57
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:48,481
the information. It will check
the destination MAC address for that

58
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:53,211
frame and if the frame is destined for
our computer it's processed further

59
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,308
the computer then checks the IP
information off the packets again if the

60
00:04:58,308 --> 00:05:01,258
packet is destined for our computer is
processed further.

61
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:07,340
The transport information is read and the application
data is sent to the receiving

62
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:13,314
application. So that's it for the TCP/IP
model after looking at the OSI model

63
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:18,199
thankfully there isn't much else to
learn. This video is part of our full

00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,778
