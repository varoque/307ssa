00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey what's up guys welcome to CertBros

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this video we're going to be talking
about computer networks

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,000
OK, so what is a computer network?

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,000
Well first let's break it down. What is a network?

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,120
The definition of a network is a group or system of interconnected people or things

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:42,860
So it would be fair to say, a computer network would be a group or system of interconnected computers. Right?

7
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:51,320
and that's exactly what it is. A computer network is anything where more than one computer is connected to each other

8
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:59,120
Traditionally a computer network would consist of desktop computers servers printers etc

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,080
But these days we live in a connected world

10
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:11,160
We still have desktops, servers, printers, but we now have a vast number of smart devices connected to our networks as well

11
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:19,900
Most of you will have a mobile phone, maybe a tablet. Security cameras. Even smart lights are found on networks these days.

12
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,400
And the list really does go on and on

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,140
So let's take a look at some basic networks and we can see what they look like

14
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,760
First, one that should be familiar to most of you

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:39,480
Here we have a switch, a router, a wireless access point, a desktop and a phone, all connected to the same network

16
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,876
This is a pretty common home setup.

17
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,260
It's worth noting that in most home networks, the switch and wireless access point will be built into the Rooter

18
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,680
Generally speaking any network in a single area is called a local area network or LAN

19
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,520
The LAN is usually connected to the outside world using a socket in the wall that your internet service provider has installed

20
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,700
This socket connects you to something called
the wide area network or WAN

21
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,660
the purpose of a WAN is to connect separate local area networks together

22
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,960
The most obvious example of a one would be the
internet however businesses might have

23
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,880
private WANs to connect multiple sites
together

24
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,520
So now let's look at a more business type network

25
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:41,280
So we have all of our office computers and these would usually plug into a wall or floor socket

26
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:48,940
And these sockets will have cables either running through the floor or the ceiling back to a special room called a wiring closet

27
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,440
This room might also be called a patch room or a server room

28
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,740
In the wiring closet all of these devices
will connect to a stack of switches

29
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,160
which are mounted onto racks
depending on the size of the network

30
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:08,220
there may be multiple wiring closets
which all connect to each other. Say for example on different floors

31
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,720
Keep in mind though this has been simplified to give you a general idea

32
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,800
lastly, we'll look at another type of network that might not be so obvious

33
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,980
Now, I said before I'm sure you all have smartphones of some sort

34
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,480
Now, these phones generally have internet

35
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,720
access via 3G, 4G and even 5g

36
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,780
Well you can think of these as basically a giant wireless network for your phones

37
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,120
Somewhere close to you there will be a

38
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,000
giant tower that allows you to connect
and get internet access

39
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,300
The closer you are to these towers the better the connection is likely to be

40
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,160
So these are just some common network types and really just an introduction to some

41
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,540
basic networking devices.

42
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,200
So the next logical question is why. Why do we need networks?

43
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,060
well let's imagine life without
networks for a second

44
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,480
If we want to print a document we would need to directly connect a printer

45
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,540
which is fine

46
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,360
but what if we have multiple computers?

47
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,500
we would need multiple directly connected printers, right?

48
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,220
Which isn't so fine

49
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,120
The beauty of a network is we can share resources.

50
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,740
if I have a file and I want to send it to someone I can.

51
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,180
They can also share the file with everyone else

52
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:42,180
we can have shared printers that everyone can use. We can even have servers that could store these files for us

53
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,760
Of course, file sharing and printing is just one example

54
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,330
but this could be pretty much
anything. And all of this even before we

55
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:57,020
start talking about the internet, which
by the way, is just a giant network

56
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,690
with the internet, we can search for anything we want

57
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,640
we literally have the world's knowledge
at our fingertips

58
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,520
We have Email

59
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,160
We can message our friends telephone calls over the

60
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,500
We can use hosted computing

61
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,440
Telephone calls over the internet

62
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,120
and of course, awesome YouTube
content

63
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,980
So networking has changed the world and how we live in it

64
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,620
It's a topic I still get excited about and there's no

65
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,340
shortage of new things to learn. We'll go
over a lot of this in more detail as we go

66
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,320
